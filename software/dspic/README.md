Notes on folder structure
=========================

The source code is split into 3 main categories.
 + ```drv/``` Code related to low-level operations (e.g. interrupt handling and event posting).
 + ```core/``` Framework and utility code, such as the event system.
 + ```usr/``` User level code that deals with the processing of events.
