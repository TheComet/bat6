When designing a PCB --  especially  when  a  switch-mode  power  converter is a
central  component  to  the  design  --  the  location  of  components and their
\emph{routing} (electrical connections) can be  critical  for correct operation.
Some  of  the  more  important  items  that  were  considered  are  listed here.
\begin{itemize}
    \item
        High frequency, high power loops are routed as tightly as possible.
    \item
        Sensitive, high impedance traces are kept separate from other signals
        and routed as differential pairs where necessary.
    \item
        Digital logic is kept separate from analog and high power circuitry.
    \item
        Power rails and their bypass capacitors need to be placed intelligently.
    \item
        Larger copper areas can be used to meet heat dissipation requirements.
    \item
        The positioning of mechanical parts can be annoying because they take up
        way more space than what one might initially, naively, expect.
\end{itemize}

Figure \ref{fig:pcb:partitioning} shows how our \SI{60x60}{\milli\meter} printed
circuit board is partitioned.  In  particular we would like to emphasise how the
ground plane has been split from top to  bottom, physically separating partition
\emph{A} from the other three  partitions,  and  how the LT3741 is placed in the
center where the two planes join.  Partition  \emph{A}  contains high power/high
frequency components, such  as  the two switching MOSFETs, the inductor, and the
output capacitors, whereas the other partitions contain more sensitive circuitry
(in particular partition \emph{C}). The  split helps minimize any crosstalk. The
LT3741 chip is placed at the joining position of the two split planes because it
must communicated with  the  digital  logic  as  well  as  power  the high power
circuitry.

Partition \emph{C} contains the micro  controller, LCD header, push/twist button
header and other digital components.

Partition \emph{B} contains the components responsible for generating  the three
voltage rails discussed in section \ref{sec:voltage_rails}. It was placed at the
bottom  of  the  board  where  the power input is located, to minimize the trace
lengths required for power distribution on the board, and it was also placed far
away  from  partition \emph{B} such that interference with the digital circuitry
is minimized.

Partition \emph{D} is  electrically  isolated  from  the rest of the circuit and
contains  the  components responsible for USB  communication.  It  was  isolated
because the  voltage  potential  of a connected USB device may be different than
the potential our device is running on.

Figure \ref{fig:pcb:loops1} shows the two critical loops  where  short intervals
of high amounts of current flow in this design. The first (green) loop is active
when the switching  MOSFET  $V_2$ is conducting and transferring charge from the
input bypass capacitors $C_3$, $C_4$, $C_{12}$ and  $C_1$  through  the resistor
$R4$  into  the  inductor  $L_1$.  The  second  (blue) loop is active  when  the
switching mosfet $V_3$ is conducting and transferring  charge  from the inductor
$L_1$ through the resistor $R_4$  into  the  output  bypass capacitors $C_{15}$,
$C_{11}$, $C_7$ and $C_8$.

It is critical for the total physical length of these loops to be minimized. Our
solution can be seen in the physical PCB  layout in figure \ref{fig:pcb:loops2}.
