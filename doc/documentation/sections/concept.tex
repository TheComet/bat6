Underpinning  our  device  is  a  microcontroller which  has  as  its  primary
responsibilities the  handling of IO tasks  (such as user interaction  and the
display) and  controlling the step-down converter. Power  delivery is realised
with a prebuilt DC power supply unit as per the requirements.

With  an  eye towards  potential  serial  production,  a proprietary  PCB  was
developed.  This allows tight control  over impedances in the lines connecting
critical  components and  brings the  behavior  of the  prototype device  much
closer  to  a mass  produced  version  than  a breadboard  solution  could. It
should  also  be  pointed  out  that  trace  routing,  lengths  and  component
placement are crucial,  as is discussed in  section \ref{sec:verification} (p.
\pageref{sec:verification}ff), \emph{Verification}.

Interaction with  our device can  be done both  via physical interface  on the
device itself,  which is comprised  of a display  and a push-twist  button, as
well as  on a PC  connected by USB  using our software  \emph{Smooth} (section
\ref{subsec:frontend}, p. \pageref{subsec:frontend}ff).

\subsection{Goals of the model}
Our aim is to have a simple model, as usability is more important than accuracy. In other words, our model should have a small set of parameters, which can be easily determined by the user. Further it must respect solar irradiation, as we want to model how clouded skies or a partially covered module affects its output.

\subsection{Model for one solar cell}
As Basis for our model serves the single diode model of the ideal PV cell \todo{comprehensive appr}. The I-V characteristic of this circuit is
\begin{equation}
 I = I_{pv,cell} - I_{o,cell} \left[ \exp \left( \frac{qV}{akT} \right) - 1 \right]
 \end{equation}
