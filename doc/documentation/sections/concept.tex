This section  primrarily deals with  the underlying mathematics used  to model
the  various configurations  of solar  cells the  device needs  to be  able to
emulate. Additionally, it presents a brief overview of the hardware.

%Our device is based  on a microcontroller, which is used  to handle user input
%and output and  controls the step-down converter.  Power  delivery is realised
%with a  prebuilt DC  power supply  unit. In addition  to interacting  with the
%device directly, users can also connect a PC to our device by USB and then use
%our front-end  software \emph{Smooth}  to interface  with the  device (section
%\ref{subsec:frontend}, p. \pageref{subsec:frontend}ff).

%With an eye towards  potential serial production, we developed our own PCB. This
%allows  tight  control  over impedances  in  the  connections  between  critical
%components and brings the behavior of the prototype device much closer to a mass
%produced version than a breadboard solution could. This is because trace routing
%lengths and component placement are  crucial factors, as is discussed in section
%\ref{sec:verification}  (p.  \pageref{sec:verification}ff), \emph{Verification}.

\subsection{The Model}
% **************************************************************************** %

The aim in developing  our model was to find the  sweet spot between usability
and  accuracy. It  should  have  a  small,  comprehensive  set  of  parameters
which  can be  easily understood  by the  user, while  still representing  the
actual physics  accurately enough to  yield good results.
%This  includes solar
%irradiation, as  we want  to model  how clouded skies  or a  partially covered
%module affects overall output.

\subsubsection{Single Solar Cell}
% **************************************************************************** %

The single diode model of  the ideal PV cell\cite{ref:villa:pvmodel} serves as
a basis for our model.  The I-V  characteristic of this model can be expressed
with
\begin{equation} \label{eq:I-V_old}
    I = I_{pv} - I_o \left[ \exp \left( \frac{V}{V_T} \right) - 1 \right]
\end{equation}
whereby $I_{pv}$  is the  generated current,  $I_o$ is  the diode  current and
$V_T$ is the  thermal voltage.  Although these three parameters  depend on the
junction temperature, the inclusion of the junction temperature into our model
as a parameter would only contribute a minor correction factor, negligible for
our purposes.  For this reason we can simplify our model if we assume that the
temperature is equal  to the nominal temperature $T_n  = 298.15K$. The thermal
voltage is defined as
\begin{equation}
    V_T = a k T / q
\end{equation}
whereby $T$ is the junction temperature,  $k$ is the Boltzman-constant, $q$ is
the elementary  charge and $a$ is  the diode ideality factor,  which typically
lies around 1.2 for silicon substrates. This gives us $V_T \approx 30.8mV$ for
one cell. The current generated by the cell is defined as
\begin{equation}
    I_{pv} = \left( I_n + K_I \Delta_T \right) \frac{G}{G_n}
\end{equation}
where $I_n$ is the  nominal  current and $G$ and $G_n$ is the actual and nominal
solar   irradiation,   respectively.    A    common    optimisation,   according
to\cite{ref:villa:pvmodel}, is to set $I_n \approx I_{sc}$ and again assume that
the  temperature  is  constant  ($T  =  T_n$), giving  us  $\Delta_T  =  0$  and
simplifying this formula to
\begin{equation} \label{eq:I_pv}
    I_{pv} = I_{sc} \frac{G}{G_n}
\end{equation}
Finally, the  diode  leakage  current  at  the nominal temperature \footnote{For
other temperatures please see \cite{ref:villa:pvmodel}} is
\begin{equation} \label{eq:I_o}
    I_o = \frac{I_{sc}}{e^{V_{oc} / V_T} - 1}
\end{equation}
If  we   insert   equations   \eqref{eq:I_o}   and   \eqref{eq:I_pv}  back  into
\eqref{eq:I-V_old} we yield
\begin{equation}
    I = I_{sc} \left( \frac{G}{G_n} - \frac{e^{\frac{V}{V_T}}-1}{e^{\frac{V_{oc}}{V_T}}-1} \right)
\end{equation}
If we now assume $V_{oc} > 5 * V_T$ we can  say  that  $e^{\frac{V_{oc}}{V_T}}-1
\approx e^{\frac{V_{oc}}{V_T}}$ and our final formula becomes
\begin{equation} \label{eq:I-V}
    I = I_{sc} \left( \frac{G}{G_n} - e^{\frac{V - V_{oc}}{V_T}} \right)
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Multiple Cells in Series}
% **************************************************************************** %

If the solar irradiation is the same  for  every  cell in series, then the whole
array  can be simulated using equation \eqref{eq:I-V}, where $V_{oc}$  and  $V_T$
are linearly scaled with the number of cells.

If the irradiation isn't the same for all  cells,  such  as  when  one  cell  is
shaded, a more complex model must be used.

    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{images/model/steps.png}
    \captionof{figure}{The typical characteristic of modules connected in series or in parallel}
    \label{fig:model:steps}
\end{minipage}


Figure \ref{fig:model:shaded}  shows varied characteristic curves  of a shaded
PV  module and  the effect  of bypass  diodes on  them.  In  our model  we can
imitate the I-V  curve of an array with  a shaded cell and no  bypass diode by
setting $V_T = V_{oc}$.

%Figure \ref{fig:model:shaded}  shows  what  varied  characteristics  of a shaded
%PV-module  look  like  and  how  bypass  diodes affect them. In our model we can
%imitate  the  I-V  curve of an array with a shaded cell and no bypass  diode  by
%setting $V_T = V_{oc}$.

The  characteristic  curves  shown  in  Figure  \ref{fig:model:steps}  show  how
``steps'' emerge when two or more modules  with bypass diodes, which are exposed
to different irradiation intensities, get  connected in series. To simulate this
behaviour, we take  a number of curves with decreasing short circuit current and
increasing  open  circuit  voltage  and  determine  which curve is applicable by
checking  what  curve  returns  the  maximum  current  for  the  given  voltage.

%TODO: sounds confusing, maybe shorten?
