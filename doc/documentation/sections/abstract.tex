 % introduction
Simulating photovoltaic  cells in a laboratory  environment currently requires
expensive  and  complex equipment,  restricting  research  into this  area  to
parties with substantial financial backing.
% research problem
In  order  to  facilitate access  to  this  area  of  research, a  lower  cost
alternative to the existing expensive equipment is needed.

% approach
This  report details  our  efforts in  developing and  building  a device  for
this  purpose. Its design  is  based around  a  microcontroller which  handles
IO  tasks  and   implements  the  control  loop  for   operating  a  step-down
converter, which  is responsible  for generating  the desired  output voltages
and  currents. Furthermore, it  documents the  mathematics used  to model  the
underlying physics.

% results
Unfortunately, the  device is not operational  at this point as  the step-down
converter keeps being damaged with the current design.

TODO: Insert suspicions about causes

With more time available,  we are confident that the cause  of our issue would
be found and fixed, and the device made operational as originally specified.
