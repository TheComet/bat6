 % introduction
Reproducible simulation of photovoltaic modules requires
advanced and expensive equipment, hindering development of solar power products  
% research problem
To facilitate access to this area of research, a low-cost alternative
to the existing equipment is in demand.

% approach
The core of our device is a microcontroller which communicates with the outside world and
regulates a step-down converter to generate an output voltage and current

matching a programmable load curve. The underlying mathematical
 model allows emulation of multiple
series-connected  cells to generate typical solar  panel  behaviours.

% results
The  device is not operational  at this point as  the step-down
converter is damaged with the current circuit board.

TODO: Insert suspicions about causes

The next step in finalising the device would be to design a new circuit board.
