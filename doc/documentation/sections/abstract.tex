 % introduction
Emulating  solar  modules  in  a  laboratory  environment  currently  requires
expensive  and complex  equipment, hindering  development of  new solar  power
products. To  facilitate research  into  this area,  a  low-cost solution  for
emulating solar modules is needed.

% approach
This  report details  our  efforts in  developing and  building  a device  for
this  purpose. We  developed a  model  for  describing solar  module  behavior
mathematically, which is  capabable of describing both a single  solar cell as
well  as  configurations  of  multiple  cells. The  hardware  is  based  on  a
microcontroller and  a voltage  converter. The microcontroller  is responsible
for interacting  with the outside world,  while the converter's purpose  is to
generate the desired voltages and currents on the device's output.

% results
At this  point, the  interface and  most of the  circuitry works  as intended.
However, due to  a design error, our circuit overloads  the voltage converter,
causing  irreparable  damage.   Based  on  measurements  and  simulations,  we
consider the likely cause to be overlong connections between the converter and
other components.  The next step in finalising the device would be to design a
new circuit board for fixing this issue.
