 % introduction
Simulating  solar  modules  in  a laboratory  environment  currently  requires
expensive  and complex  equipment, hindering  development of  new solar  power
products. To  facilitate  research  into  solar  panel  behavior,  a  low-cost
solution for simulating solar modules is needed.

% approach
This  report details  our  efforts in  developing and  building  a device  for
this  purpose. We  developed a  model  for  describing solar  module  behavior
mathematically, which is  capabable of describing both a single  solar cell as
well  as  configurations  of  multiple  cells. The  hardware  is  based  on  a
microcontroller, responsible  for interacting  with the  outside world,  and a
voltage converter, used  to generate the desired voltages and  currents on the
device's output.

% results
At  this point,  the device  is not  operational. Due to  a design  error, our
circuit  overloads  the  voltage converter,  causing  irreparable  damage. The
likely cause  of this are  overlong connections between the  voltage converter
and other  components.  The  next step  in finalising the  device would  be to
design a new circuit board for fixing this issue.
