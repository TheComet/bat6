 % introduction
Simulating  photovoltaic modules in a laboratory environment currently  requires
expensive and complex equipment,  restricting research into this area to parties
with substantial financial backing.
% research problem
In order to facilitate access to this area of research, a lower cost alternative
to the existing expensive equipment is needed.

% approach
This  report details our efforts in developing and building a  device  for  this
purpose. Its design is based around a microcontroller which handles IO tasks and
implements two control loops for operating a pre-existing step-down converter in
either constant  current  or constant voltage mode to generate an output voltage
matching  a  dynamically programmable IV characteristics curve. The  mathematics
used to  model  the  underlying  physical behaviour allows emulation of multiple
series-connected  cells to generate more  complicated  solar  panel  behaviours.

% results
Unfortunately, the  device is not operational  at this point as  the step-down
converter keeps being damaged with the current design.

TODO: Insert suspicions about causes

With more time available,  we are confident that the cause  of our issue would
be found and fixed, and the device made operational as originally specified.
