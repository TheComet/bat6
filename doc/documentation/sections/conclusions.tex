The device is  assembled and has a functional interface. Thanks  to our custom
PCB, we were able to make a very compact device. Most sub circuits function as
intended (OLED, button,  USB, microchip), except for the  circuitry related to
the buck converter.   The front-end software has been  successfully brought to
proof-of-concept stage and is ready to be implemented fully.

The  primary  thing   which  does  not  function  as  intended   is  the  buck
converter. Despite that,  we were  able to  pinpoint the  likely cause  of the
issue and are  confident that with more  time and a new  hardware revision, we
could fix this problem.

With more time available,  our next step would now be to print  a new PCB with
improvements based on our  simulations from section \ref{sec:verification} and
then verify correct functionality of our device.
