The   LT3741's  \emph{Enable}   input   is  enabled   and   disabled  by   the
microcontroller's  $BUCK\_EN$  signal on  one  hand,  on  the other  hand,  it
can  be disabled  in  hardware in  case the  \SI{28}{\volt}  rail drops  below
\SI{25}{\volt}. This  allows for  controlled and  predictable behavior  of the
LG3741 during power-on and  power-off processes. The corresponding circuit can
be found in figure \ref{fig:circuit:uvlo}.

In  case   of  under-voltage,  $N_6$   switches  to  locking  mode,   and  the
transistor $V_6$  starts to conduct,  thus pulling the \emph{Enable}  input to
\emph{Low}. Voltage $BUCK\_UVLO$ triggers an interrupt in the microcontroller.
