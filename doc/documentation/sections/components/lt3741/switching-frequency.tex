There is  a  tradeoff  when  selecting the switching frequency $f_S$. The higher
$f_S$  is  selected,  the  lower  the output ripple voltage will be, but the higher the
power consumption will be (caused by switching losses). Generally, one will want
to maximise $f_S$.

Due to all of  the  factors depending on $f_S$, it is only possible to determine
this value imperically. We found a value of $f_S = \approx\SI{800}{\kilo\hertz}$
to be best suitable. In  the  rest  of  the calculations, $f_S$ is assumed to be
\SI{1}{\mega\hertz} to allow for some leeway.
