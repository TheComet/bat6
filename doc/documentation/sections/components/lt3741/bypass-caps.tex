The LT3741 is powered by the \SI{28}{\volt} rail, which can  be  seen  in figure
\ref{fig:circuit:buck} in  the  top  right.  Because  the  LT3741  consumes high
amounts of power in very high frequent, short intervals (caused by the switching
of the MOSFETs), the LT3741 is keen to feed high frequency disturbance back into
the  \SI{28}{\volt}   rail,   which,  if  not  handled  correctly,  could  cause
disturbances in the rest of the circuit. As a countermeasure we used a multitude
of different ceramic and electrolytic  bypass  capacitors  in  parallel  to help
reduce  EMI.  Additionally,  we  used  ferrite beads placed in series  with  the
supply, which will absorb any high frequency feedback.
