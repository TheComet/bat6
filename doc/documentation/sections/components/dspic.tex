The choice for our miroprocessor was comparatively straight-forward. Microchip
was  chosen as  manufacturer  because  one of  our  team  members was  already
familiar with their  products. This enabled us to more  quickly start becoming
productive instead of  the entire team needing to familiarise  itself with the
tools and architecture of the microcontroller from scratch.

Additionally, Microchip provides good  developer tools for free. For selecting
a  specific  model,   the  following  criteria  eventually  lead   us  to  the
\code{dsPIC33EP16GS506}:

\begin{itemize}
    \item
        \SI{120}{\mega\hertz}  clock (60  MIPS): High enough  to allow  a fast
        control loop.
    \item
        2 ADCs  and 2  DACs with external  voltage reference: Required  by the
        control model we use (see section \code{TODO}.
    \item
        PGA    (Programmable    Gain    Amplifier)   (64    $\times$    analog
        pre-amplifier): Allows measuring the small differential voltages which
        occur  in  our  device  and  are  used  in  regulating  the  step-down
        converter.
    \item
        Low cost of 4 CHF
\end{itemize}
