======
 + Mathematical model
    - Include temperature. It doesn't introduce any more complexity.
    - Model cell arrays (series + parallel) and not just a single cell
    - Use actual parameters from real manufacturers?
    - Dynamically allocate cells on micro controller
 + Frontend
    - Be able to model cell arrays
    - Plotting of the resulting kennlinie
    - Power calculations + plots
    - Upload model to hardware and store it there? --> EEPROM?
